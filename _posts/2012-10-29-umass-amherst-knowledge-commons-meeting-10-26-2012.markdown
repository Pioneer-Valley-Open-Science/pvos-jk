Friday saw another fantastic meeting of the **Workshop on the Knowledge Commons at UMass Amherst**. Attending were:



	
  * [Charlie Schweik](http://eco.umass.edu/people/faculty/schweik-charles-m/) (Environmental Conservation)

	
  * [Ian Walls](http://www.linkedin.com/in/sekjal) (Library Science)

	
  * [Jane Anderson](http://www.andersonip.info/) (Anthropology)

	
  * [Don Blair](http://donblair.cc) (Physics)

	
  * [Megan Kierstead](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/megan-kierstead/a/93/496) (NCDG Fellow)

	
  * [Zack MacDowell](http://umass.academia.edu/ZacharyMcDowell) (Communications)

	
  * [Dwi Elfrida Martina](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/dwi-elfrida-martina/15/799/96) (Public Policy)


The topics included:

	
  * How the form and structure of media influences a user's ideas of how the information ought to be used and shared (Zack)

	
  * Licensing in the realm of traditional knowledge; IP; Creative Commons (Jane, Zack)

	
  * Open hardware licensing and IP (Charlie, Megan, Don, Zack, Ian)

	
  * E-government and ICT (Dwi)

	
  * Setting up a 1-credit honors course on the Knowledge Commons (Charlie)

	
  * And several other topics ... all within just one, short hour!


We all left feeling like we barely had enough time to discuss all of the ideas that everyone in the group seemed interested to share.  Accordingly, I'm going to experiment blogging these meetings, with the idea that we can both record some of the great discussions that occurred, as well as provide an online venue for continuing the discussion.

Those who attended, as well as those who didn't -- please feel free to chime in by commenting on this post with any ideas I've missed recording, or any ideas you'd like to bring up at the next meeting.
