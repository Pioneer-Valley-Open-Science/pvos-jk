Quick notes:



	
  * Pics of the experimental setup in the above Flickr slideshow have explanatory captions -- to see them, click on one of the images and and go to the associated page on the flickr.com site ...

	
  * Live datastream of the freezer temp + ambient temp + relative humidity is here: [https://cosm.com/feeds/91332](https://cosm.com/feeds/91332)

	
  * At around 2012-12-12, 16:20, we placed the freezer probe in a beaker of water that had been heated up to nearly 100 C, and placed another beaker of water of approx the same temperature about 2 cm away from the DHT22 sensor atop the fridge ... notice the effects on the sensor feed at the cosm.com link above ...


More background  / explanation to come ....
