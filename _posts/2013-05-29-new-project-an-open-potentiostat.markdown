Recently at PVOS we have been very excited about a particular project we’ve been working on, in collaboration with and inspired by [Dr. Jack Summers](http://www.wcu.edu/academics/departments-schools-colleges/cas/casdepts/chemphys/faculty-and-staff/jack-s.-summers.asp)  -- an “Open Potentiostat”. [Potentiostats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiostat) are commonly used to test for the presence (via electrical activity) of particular compounds and microbes in solution, and thus have applications in environmental monitoring, food and drug testing, and many other areas. Typically, potentiostats are used in a research or industrial laboratory context for these purposes, and most commercially-available potentiostats are very expensive ($1000 is on the “cheap” side). There have been [several](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0023783) [initiatives](https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/ee476/FinalProjects/s2010/esf59_akh75/esf59_akh75/index.html) in the last decade that have focused on designing cheaper alternatives; and when investigating technologies related to water quality assessment, we were introduced to Jack's potentiostat design, which is based on a “Launchpad” microcontroller. We’ve begun working with Jack on porting his design to an Arduino-based platform (with which we’re more familiar), and we’re planning on tracking our progress on this blog and on publiclaboratory.org. We’ve also begun to discuss possible applications of a DIY potentiostat in a research and environmental monitoring setting with [Dr. Julian Tyson](http://www.chem.umass.edu/faculty/tyson.html), who has already done extensive research into inexpensive, accessible techniques for e.g. assessing arsenic in water and food.

Speaking of applications -- what, in general, might one use a potentiostat for? We’ve got several applications in mind, including:



	
  * **Tracking heavy metals concentrations in rivers and elsewhere.** Various industrial processes used in the US and abroad can lead to the contamination of water with heavy metals that are dangerous to humans, like mercury and arsenic. An inexpensive, battery-powered potentiostat -- communicating over the cellular network, perhaps, or merely recording locally to an SD card -- might be able to track *relative* fluctuations in the concentrations of these metals, making monitoring these contaminants easier. We’ve already had some fantastic and inspiring discussions around these sorts of applications with Jack and Julian, as well as with [Charlie Schweik](http://eco.umass.edu/people/faculty/schweik-charles-m/) (UMass: ) and [Juan Camilo Cardenas](http://economia.uniandes.edu.co/profesores/planta/Cardenas_Juan_Camilo) (Los Andes).

	
  * **As part of a low-cost ‘field lab’ for assessing water samples.** An inexpensive potentiostat, when used according to the proper protocols, might be used to indicate *absolute* concentrations of heavy metals in water. This could allow citizens and organizations who can’t afford to send water samples to an expensive, bonded laboratory to do their own testing -- particularly relevant in a developing-world context.

	
  * **In education.** Electrochemistry is an important part of many high school, college, and graduate chemistry curricula; an inexpensive potentiostat could render these curricula more accessible to educational institutions that don’t have the budget for the more expensive commercial versions.

	
  * **In research.** Making an easily-hackable, programmable, and extensible potentiostat platform, based on a widely-used and well-supported technologies like the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi, could allow for novel electrochemistry applications in the laboratory; when a device that once cost $2000 and didn’t “play nice” with other hardware and software suddenly becomes available for $200, and can be integrated with easy-to-use, open source software and hardware, researchers will likely dream up new approaches to open research problems -- and higher-throughput approaches to already-established research areas.


As a first step, Jack generously sent us one of his Launchpad-based potentiostat prototypes. Over the last few weeks, we’ve started the process of porting his design to Arduino, and our plan is to document this process in a series of blog posts, soon.

Please do feel free to comment below if you’ve got an interest in collaborating on the relevant hardware, software, or have a potentiostat application in mind -- we’d love to hear from you!
